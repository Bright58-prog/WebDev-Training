    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="./images/2 (1).jpg" alt="im about" width="300" height="300"/>
    <p>Hi! I’m <b>Abwa Zee Kelly Bright Bright</b>, a passionate and curious learner from Cameroon with a strong interest in technology,
        healthcare, and personal development. I am currently studying biochemistry in the University of Bamenda (UBa), while also exploring digital skills, web development, and tech innovation.
    </p>
    <p> I enjoy building projects that challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills, whether it’s coding a website
        from scratch, learning cybersecurity fundamentals, or exploring AI applications in healthcare. I believe in
        lifelong learning and constantly seek opportunities to grow both professionally and personally.
    </p>
    <p> Beyond tech and science, I value spiritual growth, emotional maturity, and building meaningful connections. I
        aim to balance my career ambitions with personal development, preparing for a future that combines impact, innovation,
        and purpose.</p>

    <p>When I’m not studying or coding, you’ll likely find me reading, planning projects, or reflecting on ways to make
        a positive difference in my community.
    </p>
